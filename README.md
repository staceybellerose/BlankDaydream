The **Blank Daydream** Android app is designed for Android TV to provide a way
to blank the screen when in Daydream (screen saver) mode. It was created so
that music may be played from the TV when falling asleep, without having the
distraction of a glowing screen. This app also runs on mobile devices.

The app is available for download on Google Play.
